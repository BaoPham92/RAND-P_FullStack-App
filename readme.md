## About

This is going to be an updated repo sandboxing / developing a FullStack application. 

I decided to do a more modern updated version from my last [repo](https://github.com/BaoPham92/GraphQL-ReactJS) of creating a FullStack app, I was attempting to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for a more concise and steamlined way or querying our API. I plan to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) at a later point to package our environment even though this is __MEANT__ to be a sandbox repository.

## Why use this stack? Why am I build a new repo apposed to finishing an incomplete repo?

Why then? Documentation as I have come to learn as I am approaching new methods, technologies, and stacks are ever changing. Having __PROPER__ documentation even if an old version / depreciated project, will eventually help to provide a more clear and concise answer on how to advance to newer methods or setups. __We ALL know__ what is like to have only a few guides and tutorials that are outdate, yet not everyone is always so interested in updating how today's current setup works. Because of such, it can make learning become misleading for other developers.

We have technologies such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to thank for.
