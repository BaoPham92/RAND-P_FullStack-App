## About

This is going to be an updated repo sandboxing / developing a FullStack application. 

I decided to do a more modern updated version from my last [repo](https://github.com/BaoPham92/GraphQL-ReactJS) of creating a FullStack app, I was attempting to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for a more concise and steamlined way or querying our API. I plan to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) at a later point to package our environment even though this is __MEANT__ to be a sandbox repository.

## Why use this stack? Why am I build a new repo apposed to finishing an incomplete repo?

Why then? Documentation as I have come to learn as approaching new methods, technologies, and stacks are ever changing. Having __PROPER__ documentation even if an old version / depreciated project, will eventually help to provide a more clear and concise answer on how to advance to newer methods or setups. __We ALL know__ what is like to have only a few guides and tutorials that are outdated, yet not everyone is always so interested in updating how today's current setup works. To put simply short, __"dependency hell"__. Because of such, it can make learning become misleading for other developers.

We have technologies such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to thank for in assisting / preventing such unwanted learning curves.

## Progress

- Update - 02/14/2019:

> Here we will be implementing the Front-End aspect with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/). In the previous repo I worked on the Back-End first due to prior knowledge of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). I eventually ran into problems of setting up due to outdated guides for the initial version of Apollo though.

> For the Back-End to supply temporary data for usage & setup, we will be using a [starter-server-package](https://codeload.github.com/howtographql/react-apollo/tar.gz/starter).
